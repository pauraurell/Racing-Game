Racing Game made using Bullet 3D Physics Library by Oscar Royo, Pol Galan and Pau Raurell.

In this game you'll need to use your driving skills to compete in a F1 race against the clock.
For every lap you complete, the time to complete the next one will be reduced, so the goal is trying to do the maximum laps as possible.

Controls:
• Movement with direction arrows.
• Space to change gear.
• F1 to change the camera.	

Debug Keys:
• F3 -> Respawn.	
• F9 -> Free Camera.
